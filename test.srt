1
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,070
《沙娜拉传奇》前情提要...
Previously on "The Shannara Chronicles"...

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,790
公主殿下  你确定你想践踏
Princess, are you sure you wanna step on

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,560
精灵族几千年的传统吗
thousands of years of Elvin tradition?

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,530
有规定女孩不能参加选拔赛吗
Is there a rule that says a girl can't run the Gauntlet?

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,780
你如果明天再记错步子
You lose count of your steps tomorrow,

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,980
那将会成为你人生中最短的半英里
it'll be the shortest half mile of your life.

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,600
打开这个
Open it...

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,370
曾经属于  你父亲
Belonged... to your father.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,670
那是精灵石
They're Elfstones.

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,730
不  妈  不要离开我
No, Mom, don't leave me.

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,820
父亲  这个人类是谁
Father, who is this Human?

12
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,370
这位是亚拉农
This is Allanon...

13
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,600
帕瑞诺最后一个德鲁伊
the last Druid of Paranor.

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,460
作为国王  我欢迎你们加入神选之子
As king, I welcome you to the Order of the Chosen.

15
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,130
爷爷还是不跟我说话
Grandpa still hasn't spoken to me.

16
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,520
外面的世界很危险  威尔
The world outside is dangerous, Wil.

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,250
到处都是侏儒  巨魔和流浪者
It's full of Gnomes and Trolls and Rovers.

18
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,670
我还以为精灵会很聪明呢
I thought Elves were supposed to be smart.

19
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,460
我是个半精灵
I'm half-Elf.

20
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,090
显然没遗传到好的那半
Clearly the wrong half.

21
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,740
这比我想象的还要糟
It's much worse than I thought.

22
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,890
每片叶子象征着一只恶魔
Each leaf represents a single Demon.

23
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,390
一旦叶子开始凋落  黑暗中的生物
Once they begin to fall, the creatures of darkness

24
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,200
将会一个个从封印之地释放出来
will be released from the Forbidding, one by one.

25
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,620
把东西还给我
I need those back.

26
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,490
为什么  它们很值钱吗
Why? Are they valuable?

27
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,990
你的流浪者女孩早就走了
Your Rover girl is long gone.

28
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,760
你相信魔法吗  孩子
Do you believe in magic, boy?

29
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,620
当然不信
Of course not.

30
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,610
用你的双眼来见证
Let your eyes bear witness!

31
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,370
神选之子  他们都死了
The Chosen... they're all dead.

32
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,270
不  还有一个活着
No... one still lives.

33
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,260
下一刀将直接插进你的心脏
Next one goes straight through your heart!

34
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:18,990
你想怎样
What was your plan,

35
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,350
给我下药然后抢走东西吗
drug me and then rob me?

36
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,590
艾尔奎斯圣树快死了  你是唯一能救它的人
The Ellcrys is dying and you are the only one who can save it.

37
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,660
后退
Stay back!

38
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,650
快跑  安波莉  快跑
Run, Amberle! Run!

39
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,030
我们得马上走了
We have to go! Now!

40
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,890
我姑姑
My aunt!

41
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,130
她死了
She's gone.

42
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,030
不可能会这样的
This can't be happening.

43
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,430
-那是不是...-这是恶魔  一只怒鬼
- Is that... - It's a Demon. A Fury.

44
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,930
还会来更多的
There will be more coming.

45
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,310
我们得走了
We need to leave.

46
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,030
告诉我怎么回事
Tell me what's going on.

47
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,640
那东西是怎么找到我们的
How did that thing find us?

48
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,930
老实说  我也不知道
Honestly, I don't know.

49
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,670
根本就没人知道我们来这里了
No one even knew we were headed here.

50
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,310
岱达摩在宫里的眼线
The Dagda Mor's agent in the palace

51
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,880
会不惜一切代价铲除神选之子
will stop at nothing to finish off the Chosen.

52
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,010
铲除
Finish off?

53
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,890
其他人怎么样了
What happened to the others?

54
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,110
告诉我
Tell me!

55
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,460
他们都死了
They were murdered.

56
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,250
前天夜里的事
Two nights ago.

57
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,630
洛林呢
Lorin?

58
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,140
我们必须立即把你带回到艾尔奎斯圣树那里
We must take you to the Ellcrys immediately,

59
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,050
否则会有更多人死去
otherwise many more will die.

60
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,890
安波莉  等等
Amberle, wait!

61
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,200
这下可好了
Way to go.

62
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,140
别管我
Leave me alone.

63
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,530
不行
I can't.

64
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,440
这是德鲁伊的命令
Druid's orders.

65
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,190
我明白你的感受
I know how you feel.

66
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,140
我...
I, uh...

67
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,740
上周我母亲去世了
I lost my mom last week.

68
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,760
我想尽了各种办法...
I tried everything...

69
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,090
能找到的灵药和药方  我都找遍了
every elixir and potion I could get my hands on.

70
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,400
我以为我能挽回这一切
I thought I could fix it,

71
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,230
把她救回来
that I could save her,

72
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,500
可是...我办不到
but, uh... I couldn't.

73
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,920
我从没想过会这么思念一个人
I never knew it was possible to miss someone so much.

74
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,870
刚刚在悬崖那里  谢谢你
Back at the cliff... thank you.

75
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,830
你比看上去要勇敢
You're braver than you look.

76
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,850
可别把恐惧误认为勇敢了
Oh, don't mistake terror for bravery.

77
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,030
抱歉我没告诉你洛林的事
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Lorin.

78
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,600
我害怕回阿博隆去
I'm afraid to go back to Arborlon.

79
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,850
为什么
Why?

80
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,300
因为艾尔奎斯圣树吗
Because of the Ellcrys?

81
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,090
因为我的所作所为
Because of what I did.

82
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,550
这是我造成的
I caused this.

83
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,210
亚拉农
Allanon...

84
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,750
德鲁伊洞穴...
The Druid cave...

85
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,510
带我去那里
take me here.

86
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,630
我止不了血
I can't stop the bleeding.

87
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,850
-我得缝合伤口  或者...-够了
- I need to suture it, or... - Enough.

88
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,040
你得立刻把她带回艾尔奎斯圣树那里
You must get her to the Ellcrys.

89
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,560
不  我不能丢下你
No, I'm not leaving you behind.

90
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,530
别管我  小子
Forget about me, boy.

91
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,220
你得保护好她
You must keep her safe.

92
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,350
亚拉农
Hey, hey, Allanon!

93
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,580
好吧  快走
All right, come on.

94
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,670
-你要去哪儿  -银河
- Hey, where are you going? - The Silver River.

95
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,490
那里的淤泥有治愈效果
Its mud is famed for its healing properties.

96
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,870
-我得陪着亚拉农  -不  你跟我一去去
- I should stay with Allanon. - No, you're coming with me.

97
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,760
我答应过他会保护你的
I promised him I'd protect you.

98
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,260
好吧
Okay.

99
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,350
很高兴看到你还算振作  孩子
Glad to see you're coping well, my son.

100
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,270
收到报告称  西境的精灵族农场和村庄
Had reports of attacks on Elvin farms and villages

101
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,740
遭到袭击
in the Westland.

102
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,780
恶魔干的
Demons.

103
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,900
有安波莉的消息了吗
Any word from Amberle?

104
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,110
我不该训练她参加选拔赛的
I should never have trained her for the Gauntlet.

105
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,360
你是溺爱她
You indulge her.

106
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,710
就跟她父亲溺爱你一样
Same way her father indulged you.

107
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,910
为了自己的弟弟
There was nothing that Aine would not do

108
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,510
艾尼什么都愿意去做
for his baby brother.

109
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,190
包括献出自己的生命
Including giving his life.

110
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,120
现在可不是缅怀伤痛的时候
Now is not the time to dredge up painful memories.

111
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,230
既然我们的罪孽又回来找我们索命
If our sins are coming back to kill us,

112
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,700
为什么我们不坦然面对呢
we might as well get them all on the table.

113
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,860
孩子  是侏儒杀了你哥哥  不是你
Son... Gnomes murdered your brother, not you.

114
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,310
你更希望当晚死的人是我
You wish it was me that died that night

115
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,270
而不是艾尼  对吗
instead of Aine, don't you?

116
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,980
知道吗  我每天也都是这么想的
See, I wish the same thing, every day.

117
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,310
-为什么是你  -你说什么
- Why you? - Excuse me?

118
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,230
为什么德鲁伊选你来保护我
Why did the Druid pick you to protect me?

119
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,480
不知道
No idea.

120
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,720
你知道你撒谎时耳朵会变红吗
Did you know your ears turn red when you lie?

121
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,650
我姓欧姆斯福德  据亚拉农所说
My last name is Ohmsford, but according to Allanon,

122
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,610
我是沙娜拉血脉的后人
I'm part of the Shannara bloodline.

123
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,090
等等  你是沙娜拉人
Wait, you're a Shannara?

124
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,160
简直难以置信
That's incredible.

125
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,560
每个精灵都熟知杰尔·沙娜拉的故事
Every Elf knows the story of Jerle Shannara by heart,

126
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,750
用魔法统一了四镜的最伟大战皇
the great warrior king who united the Four Lands with his magic.

127
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,460
是吗  沙迪谷里的人
Yeah, well, they didn't

128
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,580
并不怎么谈论这些事
talk about that very much out in the Vale.

129
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,990
那里没什么精灵崇拜者
Not a lot of Elf fans out here.

130
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,700
是啊  我也发现了
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.

131
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,200
听着  我不是战士
Look, I'm no warrior.

132
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,090
我可以向你保证
And I can guarantee you

133
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,230
我的血脉中没有魔法存在
there's no magic running through these veins.

134
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,170
一旦把你和亚拉农
I'm heading to Storlock

135
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,700
送回王宫  我就要去司铎拉克了
as soon I get you and Allanon back to the palace.

136
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,170
要是我不想回去呢
What if I don't want to go back?

137
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,350
我可以帮你救德鲁伊  但在此之后
I'll help you save the Druid, but after that,

138
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,270
我悄悄离开对大家都好
it's better for everyone if I just disappear.

139
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,010
不  这不行  来吧
No, it's not. Come on.

140
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,560
就是这里
This is it.

141
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,910
银河
The Silver River.

142
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,560
我猜你会游泳吧
I assume you can swim?

143
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,500
要是你像我一样泡在水里长大
You get dunked as often as I did growing up,

144
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,050
你也能很快学会的
you learn pretty quick.

145
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,830
说好的"眼睛抬起来"呢
Hey, what happened to "Eyes up here"?

146
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,590
抱歉
Sorry.

147
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,170
安波莉
Amberle!

148
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,450
安波莉
Amberle!

149
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,030
又在光着身子泡澡啊
Naked and wet again, I see.

150
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,590
埃蕾崔娅
Eretria!

151
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,960
你们认识吗
You two know each other?

152
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,060
你男朋友和我曾共度了一个奇妙的夜晚
Your boyfriend and I spent a magical night together.

153
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,270
那晚一点也不奇妙
That night was far from magical.

154
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,440
她给我下药  然后抢了我的东西
She drugged me, then robbed me blind.

155
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,670
把精灵石还给我
I need those Elfstones back!

156
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,770
放客气点  要不是我你早就死了
Be nice. If it wasn't for me, you'd be dead.

157
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,830
好吧  无论你跟我有什么恩怨
All right, whatever your issue with me,

158
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,060
先放安波莉走
let Amberle go.

159
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,730
没门
Not happening.

160
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,190
我跟这个精灵还有账没算呢
I've got unfinished business with this Elf.

161
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,460
在穿过森林的时候遇到的
Our paths crossed in the woods.

162
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,480
够了  该走了
Enough! Time to go.

163
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,490
埃蕾崔娅  求你了  我们有朋友快死了
Eretria, please, our friend is dying.

164
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,240
我得赶紧把这些淤泥敷到他的伤口上
I need to apply this mud to his wound before it's too late.

165
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,540
算你的朋友不走运了
Well, your friend's out of luck.

166
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,740
听着  有恶魔出现了
Look, there are Demons out there.

167
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,380
我知道这听起来很疯狂  但你得相信我
I know it sounds crazy, but you have to believe me.

168
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,150
它们随时会追上我们的
They could pick up our trail any minute.

169
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,490
恶魔  你当我傻吗
Demons? Do I look stupid?

170
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,870
确实傻
Actually, yes.

171
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,050
但他说的是真的
But he's telling the truth.

172
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,440
你觉得自己比我更高贵
You think you're better than me.

173
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,570
但在这外面  你什么也不是
But out here, you're nothing.

174
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,340
只是两条丧家犬
Just two stray dogs.

175
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,240
一个蠢货
A clueless mutt.

176
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,390
和一个自大的贱人
And a stuck-up bitch.

177
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,510
锁住他们
Collar them!

178
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,990
我觉得瞪着她无法帮我们摆脱困境
I really don't think glaring at her is gonna get us anywhere.

179
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,770
我只是不敢相信
I just can't believe you

180
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,060
你竟然禁受不住这种流浪者的诱惑
fell for some half-baked Rover seduction.

181
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,110
她救过我的命
She saved my life.

182
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,840
她还扒光了你  抢了你的东西
She also stripped you naked and robbed you.

183
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,670
要不是她对你大抛媚眼
That wouldn't have happened

184
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,930
就不会落得这个下场了
if she hadn't batted her well-trained lashes at you.

185
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,520
什么  拜托  她不是我喜欢的类型
What? Please. She's not my type.

186
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,210
你的耳朵又红了
Your ears are turning red again.

187
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,790
我叔叔提醒过我  说流浪者绝不可信
My uncle warned me Rovers can never be trusted.

188
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,110
无论他们说什么  他们都有自己的目的
No matter what they say, they always have an agenda.

189
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,160
当你一辈子都要被别人评头论足时
When you've spent your life being judged for who you are,

190
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,090
尽量努力不对他人抱有成见
you try to keep an open mind about people.

191
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,080
你们俩吵架就像一对侏儒老夫妻
You two fight like a couple of old Gnomes.

192
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,150
埃蕾崔娅  听我说
Eretria, listen,

193
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,700
你不清楚其中的利害关系
you don't know what's at stake here.

194
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,980
放我们走  把精灵石还给我
Set us free and give me back the Elfstones.

195
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,570
要是恶魔来攻击你
A Demon attack is probably

196
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,320
那或许就大快人心了
the best thing that could happen to you.

197
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,120
别逼我从马上下来
Don't make me get off this horse.

198
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,140
骂她就是你的计划吗
This is your plan? Insult her?

199
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,820
-听我的就好  -好吧
- Just follow my lead. - All right.

200
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,070
你想再比一场吗  来吧
You wanted a rematch, let's do it.

201
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,220
算了吧
I'll pass.

202
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,760
你被一个精灵族女孩给吓到了  对吗
You intimidated by an Elvin girl, is that it?

203
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,760
让你的人把我脖子上的链子解开
Have your man take off my collar,

204
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,470
-我还要把剑...-别这样
- and I'll need a sword... - Oh, come on!

205
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,310
还以为她不会闭嘴呢
Thought she'd never shut up.

206
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,280
把她放到我的马背上
Put her on the back of my horse.

207
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,220
这样的比试太不公平了
That wasn't even close to a fair fight!

208
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,750
这个世界本来就不公平
Well, the world isn't fair.

209
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,250
你为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?

210
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,000
如她所说  因为我是个流浪者
Like she said, I'm a Rover.

211
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,810
我觉得应该还有别的理由
I think there's more to you than that.

212
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,010
你错了
You're wrong.

213
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,010
都散开
Hey! Get out of there.

214
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,790
这位是我父亲  赛法罗
Meet my father, Cephalo.

215
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,220
为什么他像狗一样拴在这里
Why is he collared like a dog?

216
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,510
解开
Untie him.

217
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,540
这不是我们的待客之道
This isn't how we treat a guest.

218
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,400
原谅我的女儿
Forgive my daughter.

219
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,160
她的脑子比起她的美貌可差远了
Her brain is no match for her beauty.

220
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,160
-和我一起的精灵族女孩...-她很安全
- The Elvin girl I was with... - She's safe.

221
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,680
希望你能放我和安波莉走
It would be better if Amberle and I left.

222
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,760
我们得回去  有位朋友需要我们的帮助
We need to get back. A friend needs our help.

223
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,790
他觉得有恶魔在追赶他们
He think Demons are hunting them.

224
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,950
恶魔
Demons?

225
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,670
你可真有想象力  不是吗
You have quite an imagination, don't you?

226
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,560
放心  你和你的朋友在这里很安全
Rest assured, you and your friend are well-protected here.

227
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,590
不知怎的  这话并不能让我更安心
Somehow that doesn't make me feel safer.

228
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,440
没什么好怕的  威尔
There's nothing to be afraid of, Wil.

229
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,150
我们和你是一样的
We're the same as you.

230
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,090
我们的愿望是一致的  都是和平与繁荣
We all want the same thing... peace and prosperity.

231
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,870
我们沙迪谷虽然不富有
We don't have much in the Vale,

232
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,990
但我们从不通过盗窃致富
but we never resort to stealing.

233
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,000
精灵让我们别无选择
The Elves left us no choice.

234
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,590
他们才是真正的窃贼
They're the real thieves.

235
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,390
将我们从家园驱赶出来
Drove us from our homes.

236
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,470
你用不着跟我找借口
You don't have to justify yourself to me.

237
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,390
我只是你的犯人
I'm just your prisoner.

238
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,500
我知道你的难处  威尔
I know it's been hard for you, Wil.

239
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,260
精灵把你当人类  人类又当你是精灵
Too human for the Elves, too Elvin for the Humans.

240
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,630
但是这里能够接受你
But here you would be accepted.

241
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,780
你是在邀请我加入流浪者吗
Are you asking me to become a Rover?

242
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,360
我给你的远不止如此
I'm offering you much more than that.

243
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,750
我们是家人
We're a family.

244
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,180
我是在给你机会成为我们中的一员
I'm giving you the opportunity to join it.

245
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,620
我知道你想当一名医师
I understand you want to be a healer.

246
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,630
你的才能在这里是很宝贵的
Your skills would be valued here.

247
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,630
-感谢你的提议  可是...-别急着回答
- I appreciate the offer, but... - Don't answer now.

248
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,010
四处走走
Walk around.

249
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,450
认识一下大家
Get to know everybody.

250
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,340
今晚宴会上再答复我
Give me your answer tonight at the feast.

251
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,640
那个精灵女孩准备好了吗
Is the Elf girl ready?

252
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:18,980
没有
No.

253
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,860
为什么
And why is that?

254
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,310
听着...
Look...

255
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,470
卖了她  让她当奴隶
sell her, make her a slave.

256
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,840
随你怎么处置
Do whatever you want.

257
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,910
我都不在乎
I don't care.

258
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,050
可是呢
But?

259
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,390
我杀人是为了生存  不是为了取乐
I kill to survive, not for sport.

260
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,420
太好了
Amazing.

261
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,830
我把我毕生所学都教给你了
I teach you everything I know

262
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,400
而你还是每次都会犯蠢
and yet you still come up stupid every time.

263
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,900
埃蕾崔娅  我要你演场戏令他信服
Eretria, I need you to put on a convincing show.

264
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,780
除非那个小杂种觉得你真会杀了她
Unless the half-breed thinks you're willing to gut her,

265
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,240
否则他是不会告诉我如何开启精灵石的
he won't tell me how to unlock those Stones.

266
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,710
而我真的  真的很想要那些石头
And I really, really want those Stones.

267
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,140
等你得到了你想要的之后呢
And once you get what you want?

268
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,620
她就交给你处置  如何你继续忤逆我
Then you'll do to her what I'll do to you

269
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,340
那死的人就会是你
if you continue to disobey me.

270
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,620
我想从这个角度来看
So, I guess at that point, yeah.

271
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,530
应该就不违背你为了生存而杀人了吧
I guess it will be killing for survival.

272
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,230
你的头怎么样了  公主
How's your head, Princess?

273
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,340
你会在乎吗
What do you care?

274
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,430
-等等  威尔呢  -他没事
- Wait, where's Wil? - Safe.

275
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,610
听着  我之前没说谎
Look, I wasn't lying before.

276
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,650
-我得马上回...-知道  知道
- I need to get back to... - Yeah. Yeah.

277
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,650
回阿博隆去
Back to Arborlon.

278
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,300
这话留着说给别人听吧
Save that for someone who cares.

279
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,260
你真的很讨厌精灵  对吗
You really don't like Elves, do you?

280
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,440
对
No.

281
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,890
事实上上次和你的冲突
And the fact that it's a shock to you

282
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,560
令我对他们更加讨厌了
makes me hate them even more.

283
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,710
你有两个选择
Here are your choices.

284
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,190
要么穿上这个和我决一生死
Put these on and we fight to the death.

285
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,820
要么揍我一拳  然后逃跑
Or punch me in the face and make a run for it.

286
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,250
我为什么要做这两件事
Why would I do either of those things?

287
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,550
做其中一件  因为你想活下去
One, because you want to live,

288
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,280
做另一件  因为你想死吧
and the other, because you want to die?

289
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,770
我是不是该觉得
What, and I'm supposed to

290
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,160
你帮助我是出于
trust that you're helping me out of, what?

291
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,510
你内心的善良呢
The goodness of your heart?

292
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,550
杀不杀你  什么时候动手
When and if I kill you,

293
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,220
都是我自己的决定  不是他的
I want it to be my choice, not his.

294
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,120
这不是我要的人生
This is not gonna be my life.

295
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,670
我不能离开威尔
Well, I can't leave Wil.

296
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,680
我们得回去找我们的伙伴
We have to get back to our friend.

297
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,350
你没听懂吗
You don't really get it, do you?

298
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,360
要是你想在这里活下去
If you want to survive in this world,

299
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,580
就必须照看好自己
you need to start taking care of yourself,

300
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,890
因为可没人会照看你
because no one's gonna do that for you.

301
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,040
也许你是对的
Maybe you're right.

302
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,220
但我有个更好的主意
But I have a better idea.

303
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,740
放轻松  威尔
Relax, Wil.

304
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,360
你朋友没事的  我保证
Your friend's in good hands, I promise.

305
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,010
她很快就会过来的
She'll be joining us shortly.

306
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,860
对了  关于我的邀约
Now, about my offer,

307
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,990
你考虑过了吗
have you considered it?

308
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:56,980
我考虑过了...
I have...

309
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,860
恐怕我不能答应
and I'm afraid I can't accept.

310
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,010
我说过  我得去找我的朋友
Like I said, I need to get back to my friend.

311
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,150
可惜了
Pity.

312
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,710
这个邀约可不是谁都有的
But this life isn't for everyone.

313
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,750
威尔  这是陷阱
Wil, it's a trap!

314
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,980
放了他
Let him go!

315
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,570
你根本没计划吧
You didn't think this through, did you?

316
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,520
闭嘴
Shut up.

317
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,840
看来我低估了你  姑娘
It appears I've underestimated you, young lady.

318
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,750
或者我高估了你
Or overestimated you.

319
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,710
放他走  不然你女儿就要死
Let him go or your daughter dies.

320
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,480
拜托了
Please.

321
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,420
别这样
Don't.

322
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,020
我求你了
I'm begging you.

323
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,000
拜托了  求你别这样
Please. Please, don't.

324
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,350
我...
I...

325
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,180
住手  住手  拜托了
Stop, stop! Please!

326
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,760
你要什么就说  我会照做的
Just tell me what you want, and I'll do it.

327
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,590
张开手
Open your hand.

328
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,080
什么
What?

329
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,260
沙娜拉人  我听说过你父亲的故事
I've heard the stories about your father, Shannara,

330
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,740
但和大多数人不同  我相信这些故事
but unlike most folks, I actually believe them.

331
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,160
你展示一下如何使用这些石头
Now, you show me how to use these Stones

332
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,740
我就不杀她
and I won't kill her.

333
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,790
听我说  这些石头只是石头而已
Listen to me, these Stones are just stones.

334
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,130
要她死还是活  威尔
Does she live or does she die, Wil?

335
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,060
我发誓  即使石头有魔法
I swear to you, even if they were magic,

336
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,810
-我也不会用  -答错了
- I don't know how to use... - Wrong answer!

337
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,370
别别  我不知道怎么使用...
No, no, no, no! I have no idea how to use...

338
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,950
怒鬼  快跑
Fury! Run!

339
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,130
安波莉
Amberle!

340
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,710
他还有呼吸吗
Is he breathing?

341
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,130
你去担心你的人吧  威尔我来照顾
You worry about your own people, I'll take care of Wil.

342
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:04,250
姑娘你想干什么  想杀了我们两个吗
What are you gonna do, girl? Kill us both?

343
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,940
你已经证明你做不到这一点了
I think you've already proven you aren't up to the task.

344
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,800
我觉得杀了你就足够了
Actually, I think I'll just kill you.

345
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,800
很好
Fine.

346
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,950
把石头给我
Just give me the Stones

347
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,930
我放你们两个离开
and I'll let you both walk away.

348
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,460
亚拉农
Allanon?

349
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,500
你们现在应该在阿博隆
You two are supposed to be in Arborlon.

350
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,940
威尔坚持要救你
Well, Wil insisted on trying to save you.

351
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,980
他用了精灵石
He used the Elfstones.

352
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,980
他拼死救了我
He almost died saving me.

353
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,580
责备自己是没用的
Blaming yourself is worthless.

354
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,670
精灵石是他必须肩负的重任
The Stones are his burden to bear.

355
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,830
这只是开始
This is only the beginning.

356
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,480
以后还会有
More will come.

357
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,660
你为什么觉得我和威尔可以阻止他们
And what makes you think Wil and I can do anything to stop them?

358
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,910
因为这是你的使命  崇高的使命
Because you share a destiny. A greater purpose.

359
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,990
要是你错了呢
Yeah, and if you're wrong?

360
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,090
如今的事态
The events leading us to this moment

361
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,120
在几百年前就有了端倪
have been unfurling for centuries.

362
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,260
威尔会躺在这里  因为石头已经知道他是谁
Wil lies here because he has yet to reconcile who he is

363
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,850
而他自己却还没有明白
with who the Stones already know him to be.

364
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,810
你参加选拔赛  想要明白人生的意义
You ran the Gauntlet trying to find your place in life

365
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,180
而命运已经为你找到了意义
and yet destiny had already found it for you.

366
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,830
这一切
Everything, all of this,

367
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,790
并不是因为你而发生的
is not happening because of you,

368
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,680
他们是冲你来的
it is happening to you.

369
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,940
你们越早明白这一点越好
And the sooner you accept that, the better.

370
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,410
冷静  冷静
Calm down. Calm down.

371
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,530
没事的
It's okay.

372
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,800
怒鬼呢
The Fury?

373
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,320
被你用精灵石消灭了
You used to Elfstones to destroy it.

374
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:18,220
带公主去阿博隆吧
My instructions were to take the Princess to Arborlon.

375
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,080
已经浪费很多时间了
Come, we've wasted enough time.

376
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,190
我身体没事了  谢谢
I'm feeling fine, thanks.

377
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,630
这是恶魔做的吗
Did Demons do this?

378
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:45,980
你没事吧
Are you okay?

379
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,270
你在做什么
What are you doing?

380
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,900
里面可能有恶魔
There could be a Demon in there.

381
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,740
里面也可能有人需要我们的帮助
Or there could be someone who needs our help.

382
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,810
告诉我们你的名字
Tell us your name.

383
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
班登
Bandon.

384
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,850
谁把你关在里面的  班登
Who locked you in the cellar, Bandon?

385
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,990
我父母
My parents.

386
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,630
为什么关你
Why would they do that?

387
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,560
这不重要了  他们都死了
It doesn't matter now. They're dead.

388
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,540
不是吗
Aren't they?

389
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,880
是的
Yes.

390
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,670
我听到了恶魔的声音
I heard the Demons first.

391
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,510
然后是我父母的尖叫声
Then my parents' screams.

392
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,570
我帮不了他们
I couldn't help them.

393
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,930
我救不了他们
I couldn't save them.

394
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,260
这不怪你
It's not your fault.

395
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,800
不怪你
It's not.

396
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,850
带他一起去阿博隆吧  那里很安全
He's coming with us to Arborlon. He'll be safe there.

397
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,060
我觉得不好
I think that's a bad idea.

398
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,440
那什么才好
And what's a good one?

399
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,770
把他留在这里  跟他父母挂在一起吗
Leaving him here, chained up with his dead parents?

400
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,850
我读不出这孩子的想法
I cannot read this boy's thoughts.

401
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,270
他不是隐瞒了自己会魔法
Either he's hiding magic

402
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,250
就是不知道自己会魔法
or he doesn't know he has magic.

403
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:13,920
我看不透他
Without reading him,

404
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,960
就不能保证你的安全
I cannot guarantee your safety.

405
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,060
他跟我们走  就这么定了
He's coming with us and that's final.

406
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,200
来吧  你跟我们一起走
Come on. You're coming with me.

407
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,960
你要去哪儿
Where are you off to?

408
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,340
我们说好的  我把威尔交给你就放我走
I delivered you Wil and that was our deal, okay?

409
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,000
现在我要有多远走多远
Now I'm getting as far from here as possible.

410
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,750
现在石头和小伙都没有了
I have neither the Stones nor the boy.

411
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,220
这不是我的问题
That's not my problem.

412
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,130
这是什么
What's this?

413
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,080
你从那个精灵族姑娘手上拿的吧
You got this from that Elvin girl, didn't you?

414
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,880
既然她戴着这个  看来她身份不一般啊
And if she was wearing this, she just wasn't any girl.

415
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,080
你这么漂亮  却这么让人失望
So beautiful, yet so disappointing.

416
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,440
你永远不会放我走了
You're never gonna let me go.

417
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,190
听着
Listen.

418
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:15,090
精灵石等于自由
Elfstones... equal... freedom.

419
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,990
再骗我  就杀了你
Lie to me again and I'll kill you.

420
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,210
公主
The Princess.

421
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,960
别担心  这里很安全
Don't worry, you're safe here.

422
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,380
抱歉  你没事吧
I'm... I'm sorry. Are you okay?

423
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,910
没事
I'm fine.

424
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,210
给他食物和衣服
Make sure he's fed and clothed.

425
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,930
听他的吩咐
Anything he needs.

426
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,630
我们有内奸  因此恶魔
There is an enemy within these walls.

427
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,560
才会在派丽雅那儿找到安波莉
That is how the Demon knew to find Amberle at Pyria's.

428
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,590
守卫必须加倍
You must double your security.

429
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,390
绝不能让公主落单
The Princess must never be left alone.

430
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,360
明白了
Understood.

431
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,570
安波莉
Amberle!

432
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,590
安德叔叔
Uncle Ander!

433
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,590
谢天谢地
Thank God.

434
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,000
你吓死我了
You scared the hell out of me.

435
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,570
我自己也吓死了
I scared the hell out of myself.

436
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,550
精灵议会成员都在国王的会议室里了
The Elvin Council is gathered in the King's chamber,

437
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,310
大多数成员都将
and most of them still blame you

438
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,820
艾尔奎斯圣树的问题怪罪于你
for what's happening to the Ellcrys,

439
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,520
恐怕只有我一人欢迎你了
so I'm afraid the warm welcome ends with me.

440
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:02,250
等等  安波莉怎么不直接去艾尔奎斯圣树那
Wait, why isn't Amberle going straight to the Ellcrys?

441
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,230
因为作为神选之子
Because she abandoned her sacred duty

442
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,770
她背弃了神圣的职责
as a member of the Chosen.

443
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,590
只有精灵议会
Only the Elvin Council

444
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,990
才能批准她重入圣所
can grant her permission to reenter the Sanctuary.

445
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,080
真是疯了
That's crazy.

446
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,500
所以我们得去见议会  告诉他们我们的见闻
That's why we have to address the Council, tell them what we saw.

447
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,110
你看...
Uh, look...

448
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,510
我说过会送你安全回家
I told you I'd get you home safely,

449
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,260
你已经到家了
but that was it.

450
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,170
是的  你做到了
Yes, you did. You...

451
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,670
你遵守了诺言
you kept your promise.

452
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,760
再见  威尔·欧姆斯福德
Good-bye, Wil Ohmsford.

453
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,100
再见  安波莉·艾雷瑟迪尔
Good-bye, Amberle Elessedil.

454
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:47,910
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

455
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,800
你要说我犯了一个大错
You're gonna tell me I'm making a terrible mistake,

456
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,980
我让安波莉失望了
that I'm letting down Amberle

457
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,310
背弃了我对四境肩负的责任
and abandoning my duty to the Four Lands.

458
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,010
差不多吧
That pretty much covers it.

459
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,980
我不会让精灵石把我变成我父亲那样
I won't let those Elfstones turn me into my father.

460
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,910
我帮你保留这些  直到我们的命运再度交会
Then I shall hold on to these until our paths cross again.

461
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,470
真有意思
It's been interesting.

462
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,790
实际上并不是
Actually, it hasn't.

463
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,640
从头到尾就是个噩梦
It's been a total nightmare from start to finish.

464
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,310
我的旅程到此为止
This is where my journey ends.

465
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,320
威尔  等等
Wil, wait!

466
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:33,770
你不能离开安波莉
You can't leave Amberle.

467
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,310
亚拉农派你来的吗
Did Allanon put you up to this?

468
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,360
别担心  她没事的
Don't worry, she'll be fine.

469
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,640
不  她有事
No, she won't!

470
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,840
班登  我的任务完成了  好吗
Bandon, I'm done here, okay?

471
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,110
她安然无恙地到家了
She's home, safe and sound.

472
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,680
我遵守了诺言  现在结束了
I did what I said I'd do and now I'm done.

473
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,340
我不能让你走
I can't let you do that.

474
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,730
要是你不陪安波莉去避风堡
If you don't go with Amberle to Safehold,

475
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,420
会有糟糕的事发生
something terrible will happen.

476
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,170
你怎么知道避风堡的
How do you know about Safehold?

477
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,200
拜托了...  威尔...
Please... Wil...

478
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,220
你必须相信我
you have to trust me.

479
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,750
召集精灵议会是为了讨论艾尔奎斯圣树的危机
The Elvin Council is called to discuss the crisis of the Ellcrys.

480
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,540
亚拉农
Allanon.

481
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,970
艾尔奎斯圣树即将枯萎
The Ellcrys is dying.

482
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,380
随着它的叶子凋落
As it sheds its leaves, a Demon army forms,

483
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,060
会有一支恶魔大军要毁灭世界
preparing to unleash its evil upon our world.

484
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,630
我能保证恶魔是真的
Let me assure you, these Demons are real.

485
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,360
他们不止杀了神选之子  还杀了我姑姑
Not only did they kill the Chosen but also my aunt,

486
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:14,710
派丽雅
Pyria.

487
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,240
艾尔奎斯圣树将孕育一枚种子
The Ellcrys will bear a seed.

488
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:32,060
神选之子的一员必须将种子
That seed must be carried by one of the Chosen

489
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,790
带到避风堡
to a place called Safehold.

490
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,730
并将其投入血火之中
There it will be immersed in the Bloodfire.

491
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,360
如此种子才能得以回归
Only then can it be returned

492
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,390
艾尔奎斯圣树才能重生
and the Ellcrys can be reborn.

493
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,770
作为唯一幸存的神选之子
As the only remaining member of the Chosen,

494
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:55,250
这个重任就落在你们公主身上了
the burden of this quest falls upon your princess...

495
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,110
安波莉
Amberle.

496
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,380
我父亲告诉我魔法已经失传多年
My father taught me that magic died years ago.

497
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,980
我错了
I was wrong.

498
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,780
现在他却要我们去相信这种神话
Yet now he asks us to believe in fairy tales.

499
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,510
这些故事只是其他种族的阴谋
For all we know, this is nothing but a plot by the other Races

500
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,720
为了让我们屈服
to bring us to our knees.

501
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:26,110
有阴谋的只有岱达摩
The Dagda Mor is the only one plotting here.

502
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,290
恶魔是你们的敌人
Demons are your enemies.

503
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,180
而她是你们唯一的希望
And she is your only hope.

504
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,790
我们不能把四境和精灵族的命运托付给
We cannot put the fate of the Four Lands and the Elvin people

505
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,560
这个德鲁伊和我侄女
in the hands of this Druid and my niece,

506
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,500
我爱我侄女
whom I love dearly,

507
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,810
但她一度逃离了自己的使命
but who has run away from her duties once already.

508
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,350
安波莉没有逃离
Amberle didn't run away.

509
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,190
她是为了保护你们
She was trying to protect you.

510
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,910
迪尔顿指挥官  赶他出去
Commander Tilton, escort him out now.

511
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,710
根据精灵族规
By Elvin law, you are not to lay a hand

512
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,680
你不能动皇室成员
upon a member of the royal family.

513
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,510
这个半人的杂种可不是皇室成员
I guarantee that this half-breed is not a member of this family.

514
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,510
他的确不是
No, he is not.

515
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,470
但他是沙娜拉人的末裔
He is the last son of Shannara.

516
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,750
让他接着说
Let him speak!

517
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:21,740
谢谢你
Thank you.

518
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:28,830
听着  我知道你们在想什么
Look, I know what you're all thinking.

519
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:31,900
你们觉得这一切太匪夷所思了
That the things you're hearing are too incredible to be true.

520
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,890
但魔法和恶魔是真的
But magic and demons are real.

521
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,680
我亲眼见过它们
I have seen them with my own eyes.

522
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,870
老实说  我当时只想逃跑
Quite frankly, all I want to do is run away.

523
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,630
但我遇到了安波莉
Then I met Amberle.

524
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,900
她可能也很害怕
She might have been frightened,

525
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,600
但她非常勇敢
but she's also incredibly brave.

526
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,480
她没必要回来
She didn't have to come back,

527
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,230
但她回来了
but she did,

528
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,980
为了你们  为了她所爱的人而回
for all of you, the people she loves.

529
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,420
要是问我谁能拯救四境
And if I had to put my faith in anyone

530
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,970
我只信任她可以
to save the Four Lands, it would be her.

531
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,080
别挖苦我
Don't even say it.

532
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,310
我想这是你的
I think these belong to you.

533
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,210
现在
Now...

534
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,180
请问各位尊敬的议员
I put the question to you, esteemed members of the Council.

535
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:35,150
你们是否允许安波莉重回圣所
Will you allow Amberle to return to the Sanctuary

536
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,370
履行她神圣的使命
and fulfill her sacred duty?

537
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,900
是的
Aye.

538
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,740
安波莉·艾雷瑟迪尔
Amberle Elessedil,

539
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,300
你曾背弃神选之子的使命
you turned your back on the Chosen

540
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,390
背弃了对艾尔奎斯圣树的职责
and your duties to the Ellcrys.

541
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,970
是的
I did.

542
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,160
现在你希望带着种子去血火吗
And now you wish to carry its seed to the Bloodfire.

543
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,780
是的
I do.

544
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,460
根据法典
According to the Codex,

545
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,150
你必须获取艾尔奎斯圣树的认可
the Ellcrys must be satisfied

546
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,800
才能去完成这项使命
of your commitment to this quest.

547
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:10,370
如果你通过了试炼  它会给你种子
If you pass the test, it will give you the seed.

548
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,820
如果你失败了
If you fail...

549
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,840
你会死亡
you will die.

550
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,530
你愿意进入树中吗
Are you willing to enter the tree?

551
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:31,970
我愿意
I am.

552
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,500
要是我能陪你一起进去就好了
I wish I could go in there with you.

553
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,310
我明白
I know.

554
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,640
谢谢你回来
Thanks for coming back.

555
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,200
我是怕亚拉农孤单
I figured Allanon would get lonely.

556
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:58,870
而且我发现自己
And it turns out I enjoy

557
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,230
挺喜欢每天直面几次生死的
staring death in the face at least once a day.

558
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,170
你耳朵又红了
Your ears are turning red again.
